# Theory Papers

## Formal Theoretical Models of the Cognitive Drift Institute

### Overview

This directory contains theory papers produced by the Cognitive Drift Institute.
These documents develop formal theoretical frameworks for understanding cognition,
intelligence, consciousness, and distortion in digitally mediated and algorithmically
optimized environments.

The materials in this folder focus on system-level explanation rather than case analysis
or exploratory synthesis. They aim to establish durable theoretical structures that can
support further research, diagnostics, and application.

---

### Contents

This directory includes theory papers addressing topics such as:

- synthetic realness and the emergence of distorted meaning  
- recursive compression as a model of intelligence and consciousness  
- system-level dynamics of cognitive drift  
- relationships between symbolic systems, cognition, and feedback  
- conditions under which cognition remains functional despite distortion  

Each document is maintained as a standalone theoretical paper and preserved as a fixed version.

### Role Within the Cognitive Drift Institute

Theory papers represent the most formal explanatory layer of the Cognitive Drift Institute’s work. They articulate underlying mechanisms and organizing principles that inform conceptual papers, diagnostic frameworks, and applied analysis.

These papers are intended to clarify structure and causality rather than narrate experience or report empirical findings.

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Theoretical research and model development  
- Academic reference and citation  
- Framework grounding for applied work  
- Advanced educational and analytical contexts
