# Lexical Frameworks

## Canonical Lexicons and Controlled Vocabulary of the Cognitive Drift Institute

### Overview

This directory contains canonical lexical frameworks produced by the Cognitive Drift Institute. These materials define the core terms, definitions, and conceptual boundaries used to describe cognitive drift and related phenomena in digitally mediated environments.

The documents in this folder establish shared language for identifying and distinguishing cognitive effects that emerge under conditions of sustained noise, optimization pressure, and symbolic mediation.

---

### Contents

This folder includes the following lexical materials:

- Cognitive Drift Glossary v1.0  
  Foundational definitions and core vocabulary of the Cognitive Drift framework.

- Cognitive Drift Glossary v2.0  
  Expanded glossary incorporating additional terms, refined definitions, and updated
  conceptual relationships.

Each document is versioned and maintained as a fixed reference snapshot.

### Role Within the Cognitive Drift Institute

Lexical frameworks provide the semantic foundation for the Cognitive Drift Institute.
They support consistency across conceptual papers, diagnostic frameworks, visual models, and applied analysis.

These materials enable precise reference to cognitive phenomena that arise when modern symbolic systems operate without effective grounding, feedback, or correction.
