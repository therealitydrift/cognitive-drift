# Diagnostic Visual Frameworks

## Canonical Visual Models of Cognitive Drift

### Overview

This directory contains canonical diagnostic visual frameworks produced by the Cognitive Drift Institute. These materials consist of diagrams and visual models used to identify, describe, and reason about cognitive drift and related phenomena in digitally mediated environments.

The visuals in this folder function as analytical instruments rather than illustrative or explanatory graphics. They are designed to surface structural relationships, failure modes, and recurring patterns in cognition under conditions of sustained noise, optimization pressure, and symbolic mediation.

### Contents

This folder includes diagnostic visual materials such as:

- Cognitive architectures and mind-type diagrams  
- Compression and high-noise cognition models  
- Cycles and feedback loops associated with algorithmic curation  
- Structural representations of drift dynamics  

Each visual is intended to stand as a self-contained diagnostic artifact.

### Role Within the Cognitive Drift Institute

Diagnostic visual frameworks support the applied and analytical work of the Cognitive Drift Institute. They provide shared visual reference points that complement lexical definitions and conceptual papers. 

These materials are used to reason about cognitive phenomena that arise when modern symbolic systems shape attention, perception, and judgment without reliable grounding, feedback, or correction.

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Analytical reference and diagnostic reasoning  
- Research communication and presentation  
- Framework alignment across projects  
- Educational and instructional contexts
