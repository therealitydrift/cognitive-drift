# Canonical Frameworks

## Foundational Reference Frameworks of the Cognitive Drift Institute

### Overview

This directory contains the canonical frameworks produced by the Cognitive Drift Institute. These materials define the stable conceptual, lexical, and visual structures used to analyze cognitive drift and related phenomena in digitally mediated environments.

The frameworks in this folder serve as reference foundations rather than narrative or interpretive work. They establish shared language and models used consistently across research, diagnostics, and applied analysis.

---

### Contents

This directory includes the following framework categories:

- Lexical Frameworks  
  Canonical glossaries and controlled vocabularies defining core terms and concepts.

- Diagnostic Visual Frameworks  
  Visual models and diagrams used to identify structural patterns, cycles, and failure modes in cognition under modern symbolic systems.

Each subdirectory contains versioned reference artifacts maintained as fixed snapshots.

### Role Within the Cognitive Drift Institute

Canonical frameworks provide the structural backbone of the Cognitive Drift Institute.
They support consistency across conceptual papers, empirical probes, diagnostics,
and educational materials.

These frameworks are used to analyze cognitive phenomena that arise when modern symbolic systems shape attention, meaning, and judgment without reliable grounding, feedback, or correction.

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Conceptual and analytical reference  
- Research and academic citation  
- Framework alignment across related projects  
- Educational and instructional contexts
